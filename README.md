# Team 7 - Blogr landing page

## Welcome Sers! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out our team's Blogr landing Page codebase.


## Contributors Include:
- Francis
- Dahrey &
- Esther.


## Building our project:

To enable all members of the team to have a first hand experience of what it's like to build the project from scratch to finish, we all built individually.

After we had finished with the individual building phase, we proceeded with team collaboration.
We achieved this by having each of us share our codes for particular sections of the landing page assinged to us. 

- Francis: Header/Navs & Section 1
- Dahrey: Section 2 & Section 3
- Esther: Footer Section
